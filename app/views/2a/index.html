			<p>Replaced inline Further Information notes for each detailed piece of information with one box to cover the entirety of each risk category, and clarified that this is optional.</p>
			<p>Removed "Isolation" from the list of risk categories because none of the users recognised it as a valid category.</p>
			<p>All of the users highlighted the need for the Dashboard view to show all of the details entered, so we now show the full details of the FIE in the timeline.</p>

			<p>Moved the note for the referrer inline with each item on further information requests, rather than the last screen of the process in variant 1 or on the dashboard in the current product.</p>
			<p>The dashboard has been added to this variant too to highlight the suggested change of combining the processes for changing the status and sending a note to the referrer, this may prove to be wrong or a secondary note option might still be needed, but we think it will streamline the process by combining them.</p>

			<p>Extended the change status journey to capture more structured data. Examples of this across requesting further information and cancelling the application.</p>
